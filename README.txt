My Project is found at
https://github.com/jburgener/EECS481Project
The project folder itself is in TestProject
It is a simple tic-tac-toe app (underlying code is unrelated to sample)
Clicking buttons places alternating x's and o's.
On win, clears screen and declares winner.
Builds as a normal eclipse project
